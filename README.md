Challenge 4 - Pandas - JW

**Purpose**

THe purpose of this assignment is to analyze school data and determine the best types of schools and any factors that affect them.

**Conclusions and Final Analysis**


Conclusion 1: Overall Charter schools have a higher passing rate than District schools (90.43% vs. 53.67%). The impact of spending and student volumes could potentially impact the analysis and would require additional data to be conclusive.

Conclusion 2: On average schools with smaller spending averages performed better, with higher test scores and higher passing percentages.

Final Conclusion: This data presents that schools (mostly charter) with smaller spending averages and smaller sizes out perform larger schools with higher budgets in the district. More data from a larger sample size and more data points (school focus, demographics, location, etc.) would be necessary to provide a definitive answer as to the best type of school.

Notes: 

I used various Stack Overflow forums and ChatGPT to fix a few small code errors due to data formatting issues.
